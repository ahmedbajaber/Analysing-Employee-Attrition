# Analysing-Employee-Attrition

During my internship, I was given this dataset of a confidential clients employee exit surveys. 
I was handed two datasets, one of the employees who have left and one of the current employees.
My task was to find out why the previous employees had left and predict which current employees were likely to leave.
