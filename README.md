# Analysing-Employee-Attrition

During my internship, I was given this dataset of a confidential clients employee exit surveys. 
I was handed two datasets, one of the employees who have left and one of the current employees.
My task was to find out why the previous employees had left and predict which current employees were likely to leave.

In the end, I found that the employees that were most likely to leave were:
- Low salary employees
- Employees with no promotions in the last 5 years
- Employees whose satisfaction level has decreased since their last evaluation
- Employees working in the Sales, Technical, and Support departments
- Employees working there between 3-5 years
